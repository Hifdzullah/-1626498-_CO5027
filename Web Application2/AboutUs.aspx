<p>At Royal Canin we understand that every cat is unique. So whether you love cats for their beauty, their elegance or agility, a cat is above all a companion.

That's why lifestyle, sensitivities and age are all crucial considerations when it comes to choosing the right cat food for your feline. Only Royal Canin has nutrition for all the stages of a cat's life, including the two stages of a kitten's growth, one of the most important phases in a cat's life. During this time, their bodies are developing the foundation that will support their adult shape and size.

As an adult, your cat's body will continue to change based on age, diet, lifestyle and sensitivities. When it comes to choosing the right cat food, you want to be sure you consider all these important factors. At Royal Canin, we have developed a range of cat food formulas to meet your cat's specific nutritional needs, like weight management, hairball support, sensitive stomach, picky eater and much more. Our formulas provide for the unique needs of your cat through every stage of life. So whether you have a kitten, adult or mature cat, we have a nutritional solution that fits your cat's needs perfectly.</p>
